# DBMS Project Summary

---

## Requirements

[cite_start]The project will be a **DBMS project**[cite: 1].

### Architecture & Technologies
* [cite_start]The **backend** will function as an **API system**, where data is sent or received using API calls via routes[cite: 3].
* [cite_start]The **Frontend** will use **Vue.js** or another faculty-approved framework[cite: 4].
    * [cite_start]Specific plans for the frontend include using the **Vue.js** framework[cite: 23].
    * [cite_start]**Ionic** and the **Capacitor plugin** will also be used to convert the website into a **mobile application**[cite: 23, 24].
* [cite_start]The **Backend** will use **Laravel** or any other **MVC architecture framework**[cite: 26].
    * [cite_start]It will be an **API-based system** rather than using Livewire[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]For the **Database**, the faculty will decide on **MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite**[cite: 5].
    * [cite_start]If there is freedom to choose, the preferred database is **MySQL**[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]For the **Admin Panel**, the **Laravel Filament framework** will be used, as it is easier than creating admin pages from scratch[cite: 29, 30].

## Project Structure

[cite_start]The project will contain **three main folders**: **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **Admin**[cite: 13, 14].

* [cite_start]**Frontend**: Contains the frontend code[cite: 15, 18].
* [cite_start]**Backend**: Contains the backend code[cite: 15, 19].
* [cite_start]**Admin**: Contains the code for the **Admin panel**, which will be **separated from the frontend** part[cite: 16, 20, 21].

## Git System (GLT System)

* [cite_start]There will be a **repository** for this DBMS project[cite: 7, 8].
* [cite_start]The **main branch** will be the **DEV branch**[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]For every new feature, a new branch will be created from the DEV branch[cite: 9].
    * [cite_start]Feature branches should be named, for example, `FEATURE_graph` for a graph feature[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]After writing every workable function, the user must **commit** to that feature branch[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]Once a branch is created, the user needs to create a **pull request** against the **DEV branch**[cite: 12].
